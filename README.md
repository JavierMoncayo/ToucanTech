# ToucanTech
Demo for ToucanTech.

For this demo I used CodeIgniter framework.
It's running under ubuntu serve and with MySQL database engine.
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1 -> Unzip the file "ToucanTech_JavierMoncayo.zip" where is all the frame.
2 -> Execute "ToucanTech.sql" to create the database structure and some example data.
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
There is not intallation requierements, only, if you are going to use it in you owns machine, 
in the "database" file under "APPLICATION->CONFIGURATION(->database.php)" folder, PLEASE CHANGE the lines 78,79,80 to setup your envirorment.

About the database, I attach a .sql file to run under MySQL. The structure is only two tables, one of them with the
members information: (ID, name, email, id_school) and other with school information: (ID, name). With the column of
"id_school" in members table, we have the ralation to "schools" table.

About the way of programming, is based in MVC model.
  -Controller: Javi_Controller.
  -Model: Javi_Model.
  -Views:
    -Common:
        top.php
        bottom.php
     demoToucanTech.php -> Main view
     D_MemberList.php -> For AJAX implementation
     D_SchoolDetails.php -> For AJAX implementation
